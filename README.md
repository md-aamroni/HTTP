## HTTP and HTTPS
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer.

- HTTP = HyperText Transfer Protocol
- HTTPS = HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure
